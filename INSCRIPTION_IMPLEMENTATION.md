# Inscription System Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of the inscription system that allows enrolling students in classes with payment processing.

## Components Created

### 1. Entity Updates
- **Inscription Entity**: Enhanced with additional fields (created_at, updated_at, notes) and methods
- **Status Constants**: Added constants for tracking inscription status

### 2. Forms
- **InscriptionType**: Custom form for handling the inscription process
- **Integration with EtudiantType**: The existing student form can be reused for new student creation

### 3. Controllers
- **InscriptionController**: Handles the inscription workflow
- **Admin/InscriptionController**: Alternative admin-focused controller with more features

### 4. Templates
- **index.html.twig**: Lists all inscriptions with filtering capabilities
- **new.html.twig**: Form for creating new inscriptions
- **show.html.twig**: Detailed view of a specific inscription

### 5. Services
- **InscriptionService**: Business logic for handling inscriptions (in src/Service/)

## Key Features

### Student Enrollment Options
1. Select existing student from dropdown
2. Create new student during inscription process
3. Automatic duplicate prevention

### Payment Processing
- Integration with TarifScolaire system
- Support for different payment types (inscription, ecolage, other)
- Multiple payment methods (cash, bank transfer, etc.)

### Status Management
- Pending: Initial state
- Confirmed: After verification
- Cancelled: When inscription is cancelled
- Completed: When all requirements are fulfilled

## Usage

### Creating a New Inscription
1. Navigate to `/inscription/new`
2. Select existing student or fill in new student details
3. Select class for enrollment
4. Enter payment information
5. Submit form

### Managing Inscriptions
- View all inscriptions at `/inscription`
- Filter by student name, class, or status
- View details of specific inscriptions
- Confirm or cancel inscriptions as needed

## Technical Notes

### Form Handling
The system uses a hybrid approach:
- Existing students can be selected from a dropdown
- New students can be created inline using individual form fields
- This approach avoids the complexity of embedded forms while maintaining usability

### Data Flow
1. Form submission captures student, class, and payment data
2. Controller processes the data and creates entities
3. Entities are persisted to the database
4. Users are redirected to the inscription list

### Styling
All templates follow the existing admin theme with consistent styling using Tailwind CSS classes.
